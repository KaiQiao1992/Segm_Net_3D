# TensorFlow 3-D Segmentation Networks Library #

This library is at the moment an implementation of a 3-D U-net using dice loss and batch normalization, implemented in TensorFlow. The idea is to keep on adding network topologies...

### How do I get set up? ###

* You need TensorFlow obviously and GPU (recomended)
* Configuration: Just import it
* Dependencies: Numpy, skimage (for shape generation in example)
* How to run tests:
Open the jupyter notebooks and hit "run"
